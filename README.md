These are lua scripts for controlling a robot from your computer in the minecraft mod OpenComputers

RobotController.lua is meant to run on the computer where it will communicate to the robot through the wireless network card.

The autorun.lua scripts is saved on a floppy disk and runs automatically when the robot is turned on.

Through RobotController you will pass 2 different positions see example below

Enter robot command <br />
10,15,20,50,55,60

10, 15 and 20 are the x,y,z start position so where the robot will start digging from.
50, 55 and 60 are the x,y,z stop position so where the robot stops digging.
